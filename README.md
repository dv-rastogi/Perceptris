<i><h3>Tetris with a different perception.</h3></i>
Tetris, the classic retro game from 1980â€™s is implemented with the help of using dynamic air gestures. The user is able to feel that he/she is physically moving the tetrominos to play the game.
A very innovative take on Tetris being played in Multiplayer mode is also implemented.

The gameplay could be checked out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkxJqoUfYXY&feature=youtu.be).
